# Jazzlib - Draft

JazzLib is a mini framework and a library collection, using git sub-repositories, that is made for quick game prototyping.

# important!
This repo uses sub repositories, so simply downloading the zip is not enough.
Please clone the repo using git and then do a "git submodule update --init" to get all the required submodules.

Please refer to the readme in each submodule for info about them.
